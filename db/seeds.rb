# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

#query:
#Key.where(["name = :name and  user_id = :user_id",{ name: "5fG3badP5ZTQ9qNdyoprrSGIZgC9gryNJu2jqaPaKkVUU1X2Ay", user_id: "2"}])
